## Project Overview

ITMarket is a full-stack marketplace web application built with **Django 4.2 (LTS)**, **Python 3.11**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **Cloudinary**.

It enables users to register, authenticate, and manage marketplace products with secure, database-backed CRUD workflows and ownership-based access control.

The platform is designed for buying and selling modern technology products such as consoles, phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, gaming PCs, and accessories.

### Key Capabilities

•   Full-stack Django (MTV) architecture  
•   Secure authentication & authorisation  
•   Media uploads using Cloudinary (production-safe storage)  
•   Responsive UI across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile  
•   Cloud deployment with Heroku + Postgres  
•   Agile workflow using GitHub Issues + Projects (Kanban)  
•   AI-augmented engineering workflow (with manual validation)

This project satisfies the requirements of the **AI-Augmented Full-Stack Bootcamp — Individual Capstone Project**.

## Data Model

### Product

•   owner → User  
•   category → Category (nullable)  
•   title, description, price  
•   created_at, updated_at

### Category

•   name (unique)  
•   slug (unique)  
•   created_at  

### ProductImage

•   product → Product  
•   uploaded_by → User  
•   image → CloudinaryField  
•   alt_text (field exists in model; not used for README images)  
•   is_primary  
•   created_at

### ERD

<img src="docs/erd.png" style="max-width:900px;width:100%;height:auto;">

### Relationships

•   User → Product (one-to-many)  
•   Category → Product (one-to-many)  
•   Product → ProductImage (one-to-many)  
•   User → ProductImage (one-to-many)

Primary image resolution is handled via ordering: `(-is_primary, -created_at)`.

## User Stories (MoSCoW Prioritisation)

Requirements were captured as user stories and prioritised using the MoSCoW framework.

### MUST HAVE — Core Marketplace Platform (Delivered)

As a visitor, I want to create an account so that I can access marketplace features.  
Acceptance: Registration form, secure account creation, clear validation, success message.

**US-M2 — User Login**  
As a registered user, I want to log in so that I can access protected functionality.  
Acceptance: Login page, secure validation, error messages, UI reflects login state.

**US-M6 — View Products**  
As a visitor, I want to browse products so that I can explore listings.  
Acceptance: Product list loads, responsive cards, clear details.

**US-M7 — Create Product**

•   Messaging between users  
•   Email notifications  
•   Public REST API  

### WON’T HAVE — Out of Scope (Current Project)

•   Payments & checkout  
•   Shipping & order tracking  
•   Real-time chat  
•   Mobile app  
•   AI recommendations  

________________________________________

## Agile Methodology

•   GitHub Issues (user stories)  
•   GitHub Projects (Kanban)  
•   Workflow: Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Done  
•   Incremental delivery with traceable commits  

________________________________________

## Automated Testing

Django TestCase suite covering:

•   Models  
•   Views  
•   Permissions  
•   CRUD workflows  
•   Messages  
•   Image rules  

Run locally:

```bash
python manage.py test
Version Control

• Regular, incremental commits
• Meaningful commit messages
• .env excluded via .gitignore
• Secrets stored in Heroku Config Vars

Deployment (Heroku)
Platform

• Heroku web dyno
• Heroku Postgres
• Gunicorn
• Whitenoise
• Cloudinary

Steps

Create Heroku app

Add Heroku Postgres add-on

Set Config Vars: SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=False, DATABASE_URL, CLOUDINARY_URL

Connect GitHub repo (auto-deploy)

Run migrations and collect static

Verify production behaviour

Production Settings

• DEBUG=False
• Environment variables for secrets
• HTTPS enforced
• Secure cookies
• HSTS enabled

Bug Fix Log
Authentication Template Resolution

• Ensured TEMPLATES['DIRS'] includes BASE_DIR / "templates"
• Added templates/registration/login.html
• Wired django.contrib.auth.urls correctly

Result: Authentication pages render reliably locally and on Heroku.

Database Persistence

• Migrated from SQLite to Heroku Postgres
• Enforced DEBUG=False in production
• Used persistent DB storage

Result: Product and image data persists across dyno restarts.

AI-Assisted Development

AI tools were used to:

• Generate Django boilerplate aligned to project goals
• Produce unit tests for CRUD and security
• Debug deployment and template resolution issues
• Improve UX implementation decisions
• Accelerate iteration while maintaining quality

All AI outputs were reviewed, adapted, and validated via automated tests and manual verification.

Declaration

This project is my own original work.

AI tools were used strictly as development assistants. All architecture, security decisions, business logic, and implementation choices were designed, reviewed, and validated independently.
